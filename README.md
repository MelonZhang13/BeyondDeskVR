# Abstract
With the development of virtual reality (VR) technology, various task scenarios in virtual environments have prompted an increased demand for new interaction devices and methods. In this paper, we integrated contact-based desktop and noncontact mid-air virtual hand interactions and proposed an extended virtual hand interaction system, BeyondDeskVR. Designed for a seated working scenario in VR, the system ensured low fatigue, prolonged, and stable interaction input. By extending virtual hand interactions to the desktop space, the system could be used on any desktop. We utilized infrared laser projection for desktop touch gesture recognition and achieved seamless transitions between desktop interactions and mid-air interactions in typical three-dimensional scenarios, including pointing and selection, user interface interaction, and object manipulation. Based on the pointing and selection tasks, we evaluated the performance of both desktop and mid-air interactions in this system from three aspects: subjectivity, performance, and fatigue. The results indicated that by expanding the input space, our system enables effective VR interactions, reduces arm fatigue, and provides usability, efficiency, and accuracy for prolonged desktop work scenarios.
